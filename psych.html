            <h2>Psychology applied to our lives</h2>
    
            <p>This website will hopefully give you some insight into Psychology and give you some useful tools that will help improve your life. The topics that I chose I believe will be the most useful to understand and can be easily applied to your own life. As you go through each topic take the time to see how it relates to your own life and implement the tools as you are able for the most benefit.</p>

            <h2>How this relates to my life</h2>
            <p>I find the need to use alot of the tools mentioned in this website myself. I think that this is a good way to catalog and archive them so that it is easy to find when I find myself in need of something. All of the topics I cover I found extremely useful in my life and I think others will too.</p>

            <h2>Closing Ideas</h2>
            <p>Finding a good way to implement these tools in your life can make for a more healthy and sustainable lifestyle. Hopefully some of the tools and ideas here are as useful to you as they were to me.</p>
