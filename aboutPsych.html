        <h2>How this relates to my life</h2>

        <p>
            In my own life I find that many people struggle with self-esteem and those that do not are much happier. Our social atmospheres really do change how we think about ourselves but truly knowing that you are of value in of yourself is important. The social context often can be a real challenge and very misleading when it comes to self-esteem because often people with lower self-esteem can become reliant on social context and mastery of skills for their self-esteem. When things change and new challenges come about, they tend to lose their confidence with the changing environment and comfortability. 
            
            This is why It is important to build a good core confidence within yourself. Knowing that things will be ok regardless of whether you are the best at something or in the perfect social environment is vital to being able to take on challenges where that is necessary. </p>
            <p>
                In my own life I find that focusing on the traditional gender norms does not help me be myself. When it comes to gender, I think that individuality can be affected by the social expectations that are put upon us. This ends up being a negative thing for a lot of people who do not fit into the traditional binary sense of gender because they do not identify completely with either side of the gender spectrum.

                In my own life I find that I have an avoidant attachment style. I find it more difficult to trust people than I think others do. I think that this class will help me to keep from repeating destructive cycles in my life, especially when it comes to relationships. I believe that in my past relationships I tended to over commit without getting to know the other person as well as I should have because of my avoidance of intimacy. 
            
                This relates back to the way that I engage in any relationship which is very interesting and kind of emphasizes how important understanding these concepts are. I think that a lot of the difficulties I find with relationships come from being less intimate than I should be. I think that engaging more closely with others can help me to change my attachment to something that is more sustainable and healthy long term. 
            </p>
            <p>In my own life I find that it difficult to be as open with others as I want to be and as I see others be. Openness allows much more freedom when it comes to communicating with others. I think that spending the time intentionally being more open would be beneficial for me because it could allow me to create deeper connections with others. 
                
                Self-disclosure requires the certain amount of boldness and fearlessness that self-confidence provides. Putting ourselves in situations that we have never been in before and trying out new things often helps to build up self-confidence. So perhaps trying out more self-disclosure is what will be most effective in building self-confidence for me.

                Parasocial relationships are another way that these technologies have been slowly replacing the need to interact with others. Passively engaging with someone on the internet without the need to put in any real effort to communicate can lead to long term negative effects.  Because it is so easy it takes away our ability to communicate properly over time and ends up making us more and more passive in communication. 
                
                Communication apprehension and anxiety can be exacerbated because when you end up disengaging with others as a habit it ends up isolating you. This also leads to loneliness and depression. This can be the effect of parasocial relationships over time while simultaneously disengaging with others and being engaged with technology instead.

                People usually tend to lean toward one or the other. Me for example, I tend to lean toward the more rational end of the spectrum and often have difficulty with the emotional side. Solving practical problems comes to me naturally and solving complex emotional problems not so much. Expressing the way, I feel around others is exceedingly difficult and engaging with people about complex emotional issues the same. That said, I am looking to strike a balance between the two all the time. For me that involves becoming more engaged with my emotional side while for others it could mean the exact opposite. 
                
                Feeling more emotional tends to affect how you choose your coping strategy. Often when we feel anxious, or upset we look for a distraction of some sort or avoid engaging with our emotions in some way. Disengaging with the issue all together is another good example of fully emotional coping, not that all coping mechanisms that are emotional are negative. In fact, we need emotional support and connection to really have a healthy mind. When rationality takes over though it tends to be seen as a good thing. When we focus on solving practical issues in our lives by exercising, focusing on our job, or engaging in productive activities, we often feel like we are doing the best thing we can do with our time. And this is true most of the time, but this is not the case when it comes at the cost of our emotional wel

                    The last thing you want is to burn out trust me I would know. During my late teens I spent all my time working in food service and eventually in food service management. Coming in for extra shifts, working late hours and putting in the extra mile, everything was going great until I burnt out. The time in which it took me to recover was much more than I would have imagined, it took me nearly 2 years to really feel like I was at hundred percent again. During this time, I took no time off, I focused all my energy into one place and did not put in the time to take care of myself. Leading to an extended period of feeling exhausted. 
                    
                    Although in a lot of ways I do not regret this experience because it tought me some unbelievably valuable lessons though they were not easily learned. First pushing yourself is good in short bursts but not for extended periods of time, especially when you are not enjoying the activity fully. Secondly taking breaks and resting is a necessity and not something to take lightly. Third, taking care of yourself comes ahead of anything else, when you are not taking care of yourself you have nothing to give to anyone else. Lastly do not push yourself unless you know exactly where you are going!
